Cop4610 Lab 1 Lerning Report

I found this lab to be very useful in my learning of operating systems.I 
was able to sucessuly add a kernel module which exposed me to the new 
architecture. I learned that I am not able to call standard C library calls
within the kernel enviroment.The kernel modification was fairly straight 
forward but i had a harder time writing my system call.

Initially I could not get a regular system call to compile. A learning lesson 
that came from that was to keep frequent snapshots. I just reverted back to 
the initial snapshot of my fresh kernel and attempted to write the system call 
again. Starting from the fresh kernel my system call worked the second time
around. The most challenging part was not being able to use the standard C 
library functions. I wanted to use "time.h" to be able to manipulate the 
gettimeofday() function but I could not; instead I wrote my own hard coded 
method of manipulating the internal struct containing the epoch time. 

The notion of Epoch time was also a learning expirience. I did not know that
linux hardware was managed by epoch time which started on 1/1/1970. Also
there will be a problem with epoch time on January 19 2038 since the number
used to implement the signed integer is a 32 bit integer. 

I can now efficiently add system calls to the linux kernel at will; the only
setback I have is learning all the internal kernel functions that I am allowed
and am not allowed to use. After going through the kernel API it should be 
easier to write source code for the linux Kernel.
