The DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm is the most widely used encryption algorithm in the world.
For many years, and among many people, "secret code making" and DES have been synonymous.
And despite the recent coup by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in creating a $220,000 machine to crack DES-encrypted messages, 
DES will live on in government and banking for years to come through a life- extending version called "triple-DES."
