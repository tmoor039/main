# Main

My main repo 

 In the C directory you will find a wide range of C source code from simple trainings to custom written kernel memory allocators. 
 The most advanced C code is written under networking, kernel, and MPI sections. 
 
 C++ repo has introductory to moderate level programming going up to polymorphism, complex data structures. 
 
 Java repo follows the c++ repo model, going a little further to include hashing algorithms and game type applications.
 
 The MEAN stack application was the first version of vip.fiu.edu which I created and is still operational.
