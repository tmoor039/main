Josephus problem
Known as: Josephan count, Josephus permutation 
In computer science and mathematics, the Josephus problem (or Josephus permutation) is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out game. People are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins at a specified point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a specified direction. After a specified number of people are skipped, the next person is executed. The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next person, going in the same direction and skipping the same number of people, until only one person remains, and is freed.


The Josephus problem is the following game: N people, number 1 to N, are sitting in a circle. 
Starting at person 1, a hot potato is passed. After M passes, the person holding the hot potato is eliminated,
the circle closes ranks, and the game continues with the person who was sitting after the eliminated person picking
up the hot potato. The last remaining person wins. Thus, if M = 0 and N = 5, players are eliminated in order, 
and player 5 wins. If M = 1 and N = 5, the order of elimination is 2, 4, 1, 5.
