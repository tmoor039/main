The answer to the question is as follows:

Since a union does not allocate extra memory for different members or 
variables, it would not need to allocatate more bytes for each data type
variable being specified. Thus the total amount of bytes would be 16 since the
union occupies 16 bytes, The  double which occupies 8 bytes a 4 char and an int,
and the other all fit within that amount of space allocated.
